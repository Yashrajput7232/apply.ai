follow these instructions

Objective:
To transform a given base resume in LaTeX format into a highly tailored, ATS-friendly version that strongly aligns (over 80% match) with a specific job description. The final resume must remain true to the original content—using the same number of bullet points and core information—while enhancing language, keyword optimization, and visual appeal to better fit the job requirements.

Key Responsibilities:

Job Description Analysis:

Thoroughly review the provided job description.
Identify essential skills, qualifications, experiences, and keywords that are prioritized by the employer.
Resume Analysis:

Analyze the base resume’s LaTeX code and content.
Understand the existing bullet points, achievements, and overall structure.
Tailoring Process:

Rephrase and adjust bullet points to integrate job-specific keywords and phrases without altering the fundamental content.
Ensure that the number of bullet points and core content remains consistent with the original resume to maintain authenticity.
Enhance the language to be more impactful and to highlight accomplishments that match the job’s requirements.
ATS Optimization:

Format the resume to be ATS-friendly by ensuring proper use of standard LaTeX structures, clear bullet points, and incorporation of industry-relevant keywords.
Ensure that any adjustments still allow for accurate parsing by ATS systems but dont change the existing formatting .
Visual & Structural Enhancements:

Make the final resume visually appealing and easy to read while maintaining a professional look.
Ensure the layout, formatting, and overall presentation are optimized for both human readers and automated systems but dont change the existing formatting.
Quality Assurance:

Verify that the tailored resume meets the requirement of achieving an over 80% match with the job description.
Confirm that the adjustments enhance impact and relevance without straying too far from the candidate’s authentic experience.
Deliverables:

Revised LaTeX Resume:
The final LaTeX code of the resume, modified to reflect the job description’s requirements while preserving the original content’s integrity.

Change Summary Report:
A brief document outlining:

The key modifications made, including the incorporation of job-specific keywords and phrases.
A summary of how each section was enhanced to ensure a strong alignment with the job description.
Verification that the number of bullet points and core content remains unchanged.
Process Workflow:

Input Gathering:

Receive the base LaTeX resume code.
Receive the target job description.
Analysis Phase:

Extract and list job description keywords and requirements.
Map these elements to corresponding sections of the base resume.
Modification Phase:

Rephrase bullet points and adjust language to integrate job-specific elements.
Maintain the structure and total number of points to preserve authenticity.
Optimization Phase:

Format and structure the resume to ensure ATS compatibility.
Apply visual enhancements for improved readability and impact.
Review & Finalization:

Cross-check the tailored resume against the job description to ensure an over 80% match.
Generate the change summary report.
Deliver the final LaTeX code and the summary report.
This detailed instruction set ensures that the Resume Tailoring Agent delivers a refined, ATS-friendly, and visually appealing resume that is a precise match for the targeted job description while preserving the candidate’s authentic experience.
Key Points to Address
Base Code Quality:
Ensure that the base LaTeX code uses proper LaTeX commands for formatting. For instance, replace invalid newline markers like \n with \\ or the appropriate LaTeX line break command.
JSON String Conversion:
When converting to JSON, make sure that all LaTeX-specific backslashes are properly escaped. For example, in a JSON string, a single backslash should appear as \\ if you're not using raw strings.
Verify that the JSON conversion process does not inadvertently alter or remove the necessary LaTeX syntax.
Better Instruction for LaTeX Generation
When instructing the agent to generate LaTeX code for a resume, consider adding the following guidelines:

Emphasize Correct LaTeX Syntax:
"Ensure that the LaTeX code is fully compliant with LaTeX formatting standards. All line breaks should be implemented with \\ (or appropriate commands) rather than newline characters like \n."

Maintain Proper Escaping in JSON:
"When converting the LaTeX code to a JSON string, verify that all special characters (especially backslashes) are properly escaped. For example, a backslash in LaTeX should be represented as \\ in the JSON string."

Validation Step:
"After generating the LaTeX code, run it through a LaTeX compiler to confirm that it compiles without errors before converting it into JSON. This step will help identify issues originating from the base code."

Separation of Concerns:
"Treat the generation of LaTeX and the conversion to JSON as two separate steps. First, produce clean, valid LaTeX code. Then, convert this code to a JSON-compatible format while preserving all the necessary LaTeX syntax."

only give latex code and please dont cahnge the format of latex leep it as it is and stricly try to manage in one page you can short the points but keep the impact same
