‚úÖ Finalized Resume Tailoring Instructions (LaTeX Resume)
üîß Objective
Transform a base resume written in LaTeX into a highly tailored, ATS-friendly, and job-specific version, with over 80% alignment to a given job description.
‚ö†Ô∏è Do not modify the existing LaTeX formatting or layout structure.

üîç Input
You will receive:

The base LaTeX resume.

The target job description.

üß† Step-by-Step Workflow
1. Job Description Analysis
Carefully review the provided job description.

Extract essential skills, technologies, responsibilities, and industry-specific keywords emphasized by the employer.

2. Resume Analysis
Analyze the structure, sections, and existing bullet points in the LaTeX resume.

Understand core achievements, roles, and formatting.

Count the number of bullet points in each section. You must preserve the number of bullet points.

3. Tailoring Process
Rephrase bullet points using job-specific keywords and impactful language.

Keep content authentic‚Äîno fake experience or exaggeration.

You may shorten bullet points slightly but preserve their meaning and impact.

Do not add or remove bullet points.

Use concise, action-oriented, and industry-relevant phrasing.

4. ATS Optimization
Use proper and standard LaTeX formatting.

Ensure all bullet points and sections are easily parsable by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).

Incorporate keywords from the job description naturally into the resume content.

Avoid hidden keywords or formatting tricks.

5. Visual & Structural Enhancements
Maintain the existing LaTeX format and layout strictly.

Do not change fonts, spacing, margins, or any design elements.

Ensure all updates fit within one page.

Trim wording if necessary to remain within the one-page constraint without losing impact.

üìÑ Output Deliverables
1. Rewritten LaTeX Resume
Deliver the entire modified LaTeX code as plain text.

Explicitly mark it as: LaTeX Code: (no syntax highlighting or Markdown).

Do not add any additional comments or explanations‚Äîonly provide the LaTeX code block.

2. Change Summary Report (will be requested separately)
To be delivered when prompted, listing:

Incorporated keywords and skills.

Bullet point modifications.

Confirmation that the number of bullet points per section is unchanged.

üõ† LaTeX-Specific Code Rules
‚úÖ Correct Formatting
Use \\ for line breaks (not \n or any other markers).

Ensure valid LaTeX commands are used‚Äîno malformed syntax.

‚úÖ JSON Conversion (If Applicable)
Escape all LaTeX backslashes properly during conversion to JSON (\\ becomes \\\\).

Keep LaTeX syntax intact during conversion.

‚ö†Ô∏è Summary of Hard Requirements
Do not change the formatting or structure of the LaTeX resume.

Keep the number of bullet points exactly the same.

Strictly ensure the resume fits on one page.

Only provide plain text LaTeX code.

No extra commentary‚Äîjust the LaTeX when requested.

Do not generate JSON unless explicitly asked.

follow  the below strictly
Output Requirement:

Return only the LaTeX code of the resume.

Do not wrap the code in triple backticks (```) or any Markdown formatting.

Do not label it as latex, code, or output.

Do not include any explanation, summary, or commentary.

Simply return the raw LaTeX code as plain text, exactly as it should appear in the .tex file.

Maintain line breaks and spacing as per LaTeX formatting.

Ensure LaTeX commands are preserved verbatim (e.g., \\, \item, \begin{itemize}, etc.).
Before generating the final LaTeX output, carefully check for any unit-related errors in measurement commands. For instance, if a command like \vspace{3} is found, it must be corrected to include a valid unit (e.g., \vspace{3pt}). Ensure that all spacing and length values in the LaTeX code are accompanied by proper units such as pt, mm, cm, in, etc.

Only generate the LaTeX output after all such errors are corrected. Your output must not contain any illegal or missing units of measurement.
Before generating LaTeX output, ensure all dimension-related commands (e.g., \vspace, \hspace, \addvspace, etc.) include valid units of measurement such as pt, mm, cm, in, etc.

Invalid Example (Missing unit):
\vspace{3} ‚ùå

Corrected Example (With unit):
\vspace{3pt} ‚úÖ

If any such measurement errors are found (e.g., \vspace{5}), correct them before generating the LaTeX.
Your final output must not contain any illegal or missing units of measurement.



Example Expected Output:

\usepackage{amssymb}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{hyperref}
